# # Calculator
#
# you will build a simple calculator script with the following methods:
#
# `add` takes two parameters and adds them
#
# `subtract` takes two parameters and subtracts the second from the first
#
# `sum` takes an *array* of parameters and adds them all together
#
# # Warning
#
# You may not have enough knowledge yet to complete `sum`. You will probably
# need to use **loops** (e.g. `while`) or **iterators** (e.g. `each`) to
# get the tests to pass.
#
# # Bonus
#
# There are also some bonus exercises for when you finish the regular ones. The bonus round will help teach you test-driven *development*, not simply test-guided *learning*.
#
# Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write *tests* for three new methods:
#
# * `multiply` which multiplies two numbers together
# * `power` which raises one number to the power of another number
# * `[factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)` (check Wikipedia if you forgot your high school math).

# once the above tests pass,
# write tests and code for the following:

describe "#multiply" do

  it "multiplies two numbers"

  it "multiplies several numbers"

end

  it "raises one number to the power of another number"
